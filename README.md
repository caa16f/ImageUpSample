Hello, 

First off my algorithms are not in the required O(n log n) complexity. I ran out of time when i meant to improve these algorithms. I did NN Interpolation and Bilinear Interpolation of which I chose to show my NN Interpolation as my more efficient algorithm since it had a smaller L1. I was able to generate both coverage maps and Unit tests for these files.
